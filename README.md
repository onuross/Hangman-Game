Hangman Game

This Python program is a text-based Hangman game that challenges players to guess a secret word. The game supports both English and Turkish languages, allowing users to choose the language for the word.

Features

1. **Language Selection:** Players can choose between English, Turkish, or a random selection of words for the game.
2. **Word Selection:** The program randomly selects a word based on the chosen language.
3. **Letter Input:** Players input letters to guess the word. Correctly guessed letters are revealed, while incorrect guesses result in a decrease in remaining lives.
4. **Game End:** The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word, runs out of lives, or decides to quit.

How to Play

1. Run the program and choose the desired word language.
2. The program selects a random word based on the chosen language.
3. Players input individual letters to guess the word.
4. Correctly guessed letters reveal the word; incorrect guesses reduce the remaining lives.
5. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

Implementation Details

- The program uses text files (`wordsListTurkish.txt` and `wordsListEnglish.txt`) to store the vocabulary for Turkish and English words, respectively.
- Players can select a specific language or choose a random language for an added challenge.
- The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and announces the outcome at the end of the game.

Feel free to customize the word lists, add more languages, or modify the game mechanics as needed. Enjoy playing the Hangman game!
